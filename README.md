# How to install LAL in a Linux desktop machine

This is a short note about installing [LAL](https://git.ligo.org/lscsoft/lalsuite), and the necessary dependencies in a Linux machine from scratch. 

LAL speaks in Python, so we need to install a Python distribution and interpreter first. I like [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/) because it makes it nice and easy to install Python packages and interpreters from a terminal, manage different Python environments and it comes with a nice visual interface called Anaconda Navigator.
